# himena

`himena` is an infinitely extensible and reusable applications framework for data
science.

#### <u>If you are a user</u>

- `himena` is implemented with many useful widgets and commands for data processing,
  visualization, and analysis.
- Data is tagged with a [workflow](usage/workflows.md) that makes your work
  reproducible.
- You can save the process and the results of your work in a
  [session](usage/sessions.md), which can be reopened later and shared.

#### <u>If you are a plugin developer</u>

- Unlike most of the other applications, the plugins in `himena` extend each other. See
  the [plugin system](dev/plugin_system.md) to learn how this works.
